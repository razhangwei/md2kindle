# Test Bullet Points Formatting

## Format 1: Problematic Format
**Reset Sleep Trigger System:**
- Implement strict "no screens after 10:30 PM" policy
- Place all devices in another room before bedtime
- When unable to sleep, avoid retrieving devices
- Keep a physical book for reading (non-stimulating content)

## Format 2: Works Better
### Primary Factors Affecting Sleep

1. **Work Stress & Organizational Change**
   - Organizational changes creating uncertainty and unconscious stressors
   - Stress response system activation making it physiologically difficult to fall asleep
   - Compounding effect of spouse's stress levels

2. **Disrupted Evening Routine**
   - Established evening protocol not being followed
   - Device usage at 11 PM and later when unable to sleep
   - Blue light suppressing melatonin production
   - Work/news content heightening alertness
